# AmazonVineAnalysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis

Using my knowledge of PySpark I looked at determining if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Amazon's Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. 

For this analysis, I will determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews. I will use the catagory of office supplies ("https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Office_Products_v1_00.tsv.gz)

## Results: 

### How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
### How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
### What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? 
### What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary: 

### In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement.

### One additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
