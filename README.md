# AmazonVineAnalysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis

Using my knowledge of PySpark I looked at determining if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Amazon's Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. 

*For this analysis, I will look at specifically if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews for Amazon's office supplies category.*

## Results:
